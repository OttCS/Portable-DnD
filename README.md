# Portable DnD: Basic Guide
**A simplified version of a wonderful game**

DnD is far too complicated, and upcoming rule patches will keep it so. The goal of the Portable system is focused on providing a simplified game, so that new players will understand the different areas of their character sheet and have a better understanding of what they are able to do.

# Character Creation
Your character has many different ways of interacting with the world around them, and your sheet contains a lot of the options!

The character creation process is listed as straightforward as possible below, but feel free to check [D&D Beyond's approach for step-by-step characters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters)!

## Character Races
Please referenct the [Character Races](Races.md) document.

## Classes

## Abilities and Scores
All of your modifiers start at -2. You then may add a total of 17 to these, with a limit of +3 for each.

## Character Backgrounds
Please reference the [Character Backgrounds](Backgrounds.md) document.

**Proficiency**. Proficiency is a measure of how adept you are at what you do, and can be considered “your experience with what you do regularly). This score increases at certain levels, but starts at +2.
**Saving Throws**. These are equal to your modifiers, plus your proficiency based on your class.
**Skills**. These are equal to your modifiers, plus your proficiency based on your class and background
**Passive Perception**. Add 10 and your wisdom modifier, and if you are proficient in perception add your proficiency bonus as well.
**Proficiencies and Languages**. Your non-stat proficiencies and languages should go here.

**Armor Class**. How hard you are to hit. This is based on what armor you are wearing + your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
**Initiative**. How quickly you react in battle. Typically this is your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
**Speed**. Unless otherwise specified by your chosen race, your base walking speed is 30ft.
**Hit Points**. Take the highest number possible on your hit die and add your constitution modifier: level 1.

# Leveling Up
**Increase HP**. Roll your class’ hit die (reroll 1s), and add it and your constitution modifier to your HP.
**Stat Bump**. Increase a core stat modifier of your choice by one, up to +5 OR choose a feat.
**Proficiency**. Increase your proficiency score by one.
