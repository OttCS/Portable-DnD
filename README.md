# Portable DnD: Basic Guide
**A simplified version of a wonderful game**

DnD is far too complicated, and until rule patches coming in 2024, it will continue to be so. The goal of the Portable system is focused on providing a simplified game, so that new players will understand the different areas of their character sheet and have a better understanding of what they are able to do.

## Abilities and Skills
Your abilities affect what your character is capable of doing, as well as different aspects of your character’s areas of expertise.

## Combat
In combat, you have 3 options, and you can take or skip each one on your turn.

**_Movement_**. You may move up to your walking speed

**_Action_**. You have a couple options, up to one of these can be taken per turn
- _Dash_. You can move up to your walking speed (again)
- _Attack_. You may use a weapon
- _Long Cast_. You can cast a spell that requires a full action

***Bonus Action***. You have a couple more options, up to one of these can be taken per turn

# Step-by-Step Characters
Your character sheet is a full list of the different ways you have of interacting with the world around you!

## Character Creation
Character creation process is listed as straightforward as possible below, but feel free to check [D&D Beyond's approach for step-by-step characters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters)!

#### Character Races
Please reference the [Character Races](Races.md) document.

#### Classes
Please reference the [Character Classes](Classes.md) document.

#### Abilities
The most streamlined system for determining ability scores is one I came up with! It is a point-buy system that focuses only on the modifiers, and keeps all level 1 players between -2 and +3. Please reference the [Modifier Buy](ModifierBuy.md) document.

#### Character Backgrounds
Please reference the [Character Backgrounds](Backgrounds.md) document.

_**Proficiency**_. Proficiency is a measure of how adept you are at what you do, and can be considered “your experience with what you do regularly). This score increases at certain levels, but starts at +2.
_**Saving Throws**_. These are equal to your modifiers, plus your proficiency based on your class.
_**Skills**_. These are equal to your modifiers, plus your proficiency based on your class and background
_**Passive Perception**_. Add 10 and your wisdom modifier, and if you are proficient in perception add your proficiency bonus as well.
_**Proficiencies and Languages**_. Your non-stat proficiencies and languages should go here.

_**Armor Class**_. How hard you are to hit. This is based on what armor you are wearing + your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
_**Initiative**_. How quickly you react in battle. Typically this is your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
_**Speed**_. Unless otherwise specified by your chosen race, your base walking speed is 30ft.
_**Hit Points**_. Take the highest number possible on your hit die and add your constitution modifier: level 1.

## Leveling Up
_**Increase HP**_. Roll your class’ hit die (reroll 1s), and add it and your constitution modifier to your HP.
_**Stat Bump**_. Increase a core stat modifier of your choice by one, up to +5 OR choose a feat.
_**Proficiency**_. Increase your proficiency score by one.
