## Introduction
DnD is far too complicated, and upcoming rule patches will keep it so. The goal of the Portable system is focused on providing a simplified game, so that new players will understand the different areas of their character sheet and have a better understanding of what they are able to do.

### Abilities and Skills
Your abilities affect what your character is capable of doing, as well as different aspects of your character’s areas of expertise.

In combat, you have 3 options, and you can take or skip each one on your turn.

**_Action_**. You have a couple options, up to one of these can be taken per turn
- _Dash_. You can move up to your walking speed (again)
- _Attack_. You may use a weapon
- _Long Cast_. You can cast a spell that requires a full action

***Bonus Action***. You have a couple more options, up to one of these can be taken per turn

## Character Creation
Your character has many different ways of interacting with the world around them, and your sheet contains a lot of those options! The character creation process is listed as straightforward as possible below. It is easier to read all of the steps first and *then* actually go through and create your character, even for experienced players.

### 1. Choose a Race
In a fantasy world, there is a much greater variety to the kinds of people you can come across, each with unique abilities. Your character's race, while aesthetic, does affect the options you have at your disposal: racial traits and abilities, damage resistances, etc. Your race also minimally affects your ability scores. Some important terminology is below:

* **Size.** Unless otherwise noted, your character's size is medium.
* **Speed.** Unless otherwise noted, your base walking speed is 30ft.
* **Darkvision.** Your character can see in dim light (up to a radius) as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Please reference the [Character Races](Races.md) document when choosing.

### 2. Classes
Your character fits into a broad category of the special talents and tactics at their disposal, called a class. Each class is a category of play that comes with its own pros and cons. Some have access to spellcasting, better physical abilities, or even the ability to turn into animals. Some important terminology is below:

- **Hit Points.** A number indicating the amount of harm you can sustain before dying.
- **Hit Dice.** A number which determines

Please reference the [Character Classes](Classes.md) document.

### 3. Ability Scores
Please reference the [Modifier Buy](Modifier%20Buy.md) document.

- **Proficiency.** Proficiency is a measure of how adept you are at what you do, and can be considered “your experience with what you do regularly). This score increases at certain levels, but starts at +2.
- **Saving Throws.** These are equal to your modifiers, but with your proficiency bonus added to your class' saving throws.
- **Armor Class.** How hard you are to hit. This is based on what armor you are wearing + your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
- **Initiative.** How quickly you react in battle. Typically this is your dexterity modifier, unless your class specifies otherwise.
- **Speed.** Unless otherwise specified by your chosen race, your base walking speed is 30ft.
- **Hit Points.** Take the highest number possible on your hit die and add your constitution modifier at level 1.

### 4. Background
Please reference the [Character Backgrounds](Backgrounds.md) document.

- **Skills.** These are equal to your modifiers, plus your proficiency based on your class and background
- **Passive Perception.** Add 10 and your wisdom modifier, and if you are proficient in perception add your proficiency bonus as well.
- **Proficiencies and Languages.** Your non-stat proficiencies and languages should go here.
