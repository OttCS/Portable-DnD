Traditional tieflings are descendants of Asmodeus. Despite his appearance being flesh-toned or purple, his descendant tieflings are shades of red and resistant to fire, able to blend into their ancestral environment.

Tieflings descendant of Mammon/Minauros also reflect similarly, being shades of green and resistant to poison. These tieflings typically have golden eyes, harking back to Mammon's insatiable lust for coin.

While tieflings always get a bonus to charisma, Minauron Tieflings receive a **bonus to constitution**, making them more resistant to poisons and acids.

As with traditional tieflings, Minauron tieflings possess an innate spellcasting ability, tied to their Charisma, which don't count against spell totals. At level one, you have access to the **Mage Hand** cantrip. At level three you gain access to the **Absorb Elements** spell, which you can cast once per day. Likewise at level five, you gain access to the **Melf's Acid Arrow** spell.
