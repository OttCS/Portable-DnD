# Minauron Tiefling
***Traditional tieflings are descendants of Asmodeus, who come in shades of red to blend in with the landscape of Nessus. Tieflings from Minauros have their bloodline shaped by the avaricious will of Mammon, and find themselves held accountable for greed throughout the world, unfairly or not. Their green-tinted skin connects them to their ancestral home, where they developed exceptional durability inside of the endless bog. Their dark horns and striking metallic eyes - ranging from copper to platinum - set them apart from others, whether they're loyal agents of the nine hells or carving their own path.***
