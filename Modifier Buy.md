# Modifier Buy
Fairer than rolling, easier than point buy.

## How To
The ability score of your character determines their strengths and weaknesses, and what classes they can excel at. Think carefully about how you want to play your character and follow these steps:

1.  Start with a -1 base modifier wherever your **Racial Ability Scores** apply, and -2 for the rest
2.  Add a total of 16 points among the different modifiers, none over +3
3. For scores, add 2 x the modifier and add 10.

## Justification (For DMs)
With the new low end of stats being -2, players have the freedom to dump stats, and aren't encouraged to min-max race/class combos to achieve a +3 at level one. Creativity is good in this game, after all.

With the **4d6 (dropping the lowest)** system, the *average* stats total will be 66 points. Racial ability scores bump this up to 69.

With the **Point Buy System**, splitting points evenly results in an average total of 75, with a 12 or 13 in each stat. However, a player who maximizes three stats will have three 8s and three 15s for a total of 69. These average as 72, which is increased to 75 with a racial ability score boost.

Taking both of these as valid ways of getting statistics, the average player should start with around 72, including all racial bonuses. If we start the players with a 6 (-2 mod) in four stats and an 8 (-1 mod) in the other two, we have a base of 40 points. This means there is a spare 32 points to spend, and with each modifier being equal to two points, we end up with 16 to put into the modifiers.
