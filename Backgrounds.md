# Portable DnD: Backgrounds
**A complete list of backgrounds in PDnD**

Your background is how your character grew up in the world and initially developed skills.

## Acolyte

_**Languages**_. Two of your choice
_**Equipment**_. A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric — performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

## Barkeeper

_**Languages**_. Two of your choice
_**Equipment**_. Set of commoner’s clothing, a tankard, an apron, brewer’s tools, and a pouch with 10 gp

You have worked in a bar, tavern, pub, or other place where alcoholic beverages are served. You know the art of mixing and serving drinks and dealing with customers. You’ve learned to keep a wary eye on disruptive patrons and cut them off when they’ve had one too many drinks.

## Charlatan
_**Proficiencies**_. Deception, Sleight of Hand, Disguise kit, Forgery Kit
_**Equipment**_. A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and also a belt pouch which is containing 15 gp.

You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage.

## Criminal
_**Proficiencies**_. Deception, Stealth, Thieves Tools, One type of gaming set
_**Equipment**_. A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp

You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

## Entertainer
_**Proficiencies**_. Acrobatics, Performance, Disguise kit, One type of musical instrument
_**Equipment**_. A musical instrument (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), a costume, and a pouch containing 15gp

You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.

_**Equipment**_. A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

## Hermit

_**Languages**_. One of your choice
_**Equipment**_. A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, an herbalism kit, and 5gp

You lived in seclusion – either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone – for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.

## Noble
_**Proficiencies**_. History, Persuasion, One type of gaming set
_**Languages**_. One of your choice
_**Equipment**_. A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.

_**Equipment**_. A staff, a hunting trap, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10gp

You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

## Sage

## Sailor
_**Proficiencies**_. Athletics, Perception, Navigator’s Tools, Vehicles (water)
_**Equipment**_. A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10gp

You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.

## Soldier

War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

## Urchin
_**Proficiencies**_. Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Disguise kit, thieves' tools
_**Equipment**_. A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10gp

You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor, You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
