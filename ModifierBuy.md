***Determine Ability Scores***. To choose your characterâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, follow these steps:
1.  Start with a -1 base modifier as your racial ability scores, and -2 for the rest
2.  Add a total of 15 among the different modifiers, but none can be over +3 (at level 1)

**Optional 1st-Level Feat**
If you're looking to have a feat at first level, only add a total of 14 in step two, and select a feat to begin with.

(Note: Actual score doesn't matter for gameplay, but to fill it in it's 2 times modifier + 10)

*The **Modifier Buy** system results in modifiers in line with the average scores of the original 4d6 drop lowest x6 method, while allowing players to determine whether they want to be more well-rounded or focused on specific abilities. It is easier for player balance as well, as it constrains all modifiers between -2 and +3 and doesn't promote min-maxing player race/class combos.*
