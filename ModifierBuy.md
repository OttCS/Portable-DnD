Fairer than rolling, easier than point buy.

### ***Determine Ability Scores***. 
The ability score of your character determines their strengths and weaknesses. Think carefully about how you want to play your character and follow these steps:

1.  Start with a -1 base modifier wherever your **Racial Ability Scores** applies, and -2 for the rest
2.  Add a total of 17 among the different modifiers, none can be over +3 (at level 1)

### **Optional 1st-Level Feat**
If you're looking to have a feat at first level, only add a total of 15 in step two, and select a feat to begin with.  Find a list of usable here: [[Feats]]

(Note: Actual score doesn't matter for gameplay, but to fill it in it's 2 times modifier + 10)

*The **Modifier Buy** system results in modifiers in line with the average scores of the original 4d6 drop lowest x6 method, while allowing players to determine whether they want to be more well-rounded or focused on specific abilities. It is easier for player balance as well, as it constrains all modifiers between -2 and +3 and doesn't promote min-maxing player race/class combos.*
