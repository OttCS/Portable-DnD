For designing a custom race, put some thought into it. WotC is known to create new "aesthetics-focused" races that don't add anything new to the game, and add up putting more work on the DM. Try to come up with answers for the following:

|What|Where|When|Why|
|-|-|-|-|
|does the race look like?|does the race originate from?|did the race begin?|does the race identify as unique?|
|are common professions?|does the race avoid?|do they reach adulthood?|do they have certain customs?|
|are some folklore heroes?|do they make their homes?|do they die?|do they live the way they do?|

Clear up any confusion about the creature type now.

***Racial Ability Scores***. Based on the answers to the questions above, you should have an idea as to a cultural support for certain talents such as feats of strength or cunning, a pattern of trades which promote agility or sociality, etc. Choose two stats to be racial ability buffs.

***Bonus Languages***. Does your race have a language it communicates internally with?

***Abilities***. Based on the creature type, what are other common abilities in its field? Fey tend to resist sleep and charm incantations, while some hardier, smaller races (dwarves and stout halflings) have a resistance to poison. Even more, if touched by ancient magics (elves, genasi, tieflings, etc), gain access to certain spells at certain levels. Think *carefully* about theming and balance.
