# Portable DnD: Character Classes
**A complete list of playable classes in PDnD**

Your character can utilize their skills in any number of unique ways. The hit die is the dice used to determine your overall amount of health. The primary stat is the most meaningful stat for the class, and the save buffs let you add your proficiency when rolling a saving throw of that category. Weapon/Armor proficiencies mean that you can add your proficiency to attacks with those weapons. Check the **Classes** folder for abilities and subclasses from the Players’ Handbook and Xanathar’s Guide.

## Artificer
An intelligent inventor who imbues magic into everything they create. Makers of magic-infused objects, artificers are defined by their inventive nature. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Instead of ephemeral spells, they seek to craft durable, useful, marvelous magical items.
